## 🟢 Overview

This website serves as a one‑page introduction to my background as a **Web Developer**, highlighting:

- 👤 About section • education, experience, values  
- 🛠️ Skills • Python, HTML & CSS  
- 📁 Project summaries (e.g. medical outreach with Pokea Afya Foundation)  
- 📞 Contact methods with mail and phone links  

Designed to be **fast**, **lightweight**, and **accessible**—requiring only a modern web browser to view. Its simple structure makes it ideal for sharing in portfolios, GitHub, or embedded in developer resumes.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can preview the portfolio by simply opening the `index.html` file in a browser—ideal if hosted locally.  
*(Replace with your deployed URL if available—for example via GitHub Pages or Netlify.)*

## 🧩 Features & Technologies

**HTML & CSS only**—no JavaScript required, ensuring fast load times and simplicity.  
Supported by best-of-class design practices including:

- Mobile-responsive layout with fluid spacing  
- High-contrast, accessible text layered over background  
- Smooth fade‑in animations  
- Semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section tags)

## 🚀 Installation & Browsing

## 🎨 Customization & Deployment

Ready to personalize and share:

- **Brand colors & fonts**: Edit in the `<style>` block or move to an external `.css`.

- **Content edits**: Update your name, education, skills, project descriptions and contact details in the HTML sections.

## 🧠 Future Work (To‑Do)
